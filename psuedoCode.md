## Class 4 Daily Goals

### 1. Filter by Numbers of Horns
**Why are we implementing this feature?**
- As a user, I want to be able to view the beasts by the number of horns

  Each horned beast is an object with the .horns property. So we should be able to create a loop to filter through.
- What are we going to implement?

  We'll need a form with a select button so we can select the number of horns.

- Given that a user is presented with filtering options

  The select drop down option.

- When the user clicks on one option
- Then the images should be filtered accordingly

- How are we implementing it?
Using the Form component of react-bootstrap, build a drop down menu so that the user can choose to filter by number of horns.
When the user chooses one of the options, the correct images should be displayed.
